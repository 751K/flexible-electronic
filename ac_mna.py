"""
Small-signal MNA stamping primitives for the AFE.

Terminal encoding: each transistor terminal is either
    ("n", i)  -> solved node index i
    ("v", x)  -> known AC voltage x (AC grounds use x=0.0; driven inputs use x=Vin)

These three stamps (_stamp_adm, _stamp_vccs, _stamp_mos) are the small-signal
engine used by ac_solver.ac_solve and noise_solver.noise_analysis. The full
DC+AC solve (with corner support and terminal-gm extraction) lives in
ac_solver.py; this module is just the reusable stamp kernel.
